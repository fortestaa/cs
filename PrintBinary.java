	 * First, let's start off by asking ourselves what a non-integer number in binary looks like. 
	 * By analogy to a decimal number, the binary number 0.1012 would look like: 
	 * 0.101_2 =1*(1/2^1)+0*(1/2^2)+1*(1/2^3).
	 * To print the decimal part, we can multiply by 2 and check if 2n is greater than or equal to 1. 
	 * This is essentially "shifting" the fractional sum. That is:
	 * r = 2_10 * n = 2_10 * 0.101_2 = 1 * (1/2^0) + 0 * (1/2^1) + 1 * (1/2^2) = 1.01_2
	 * If r >= 1, then we know that n had a 1 right after the decimal point.
	 * By doing this continuously, we can check every digit.
