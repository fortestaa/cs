	 * To solve this problem using only constant space, you have to rethink how the numbers are being represented in computers â€“ using bits.
	 * If you sum the ith bit of all numbers and mod 3, it must be either 0 or 1 due to the constraint of this problem where each number must appear either three times or once.
	 * This will be the ith bit of that "single number".
	 * A straightforward implementation is to use an array of size 32 to keep track of the total count of ith bit.
