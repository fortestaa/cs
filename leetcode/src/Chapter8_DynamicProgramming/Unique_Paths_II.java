/**
 * 44. Unique Paths II
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/
 * 
 * Question:
 * Similar to Question [43. Unique Paths], but now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
 * An obstacle and empty space are marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid. For example,
 * There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3Ã—3 grid as illustrated below.
 * [
 * 	[0,0,0]
 * 	[0,1,0]
 * 	[0,0,0]
 * ]
 * The total number of unique paths is 2.
