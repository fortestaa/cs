	 * So, we can create a simple recursive algorithm called search that calls search(left side) and search(right side) looking at how many nodes (p or q) are placed from the left side and from the right side of the current node.
	 * If there are two nodes on one of the sides, then we have to check if the child node on this side is p or q (because in this case the current node is the common ancestor).
	 * If the child node is neither p nor q, we should continue to search further (starting from the child).
	 * If one of the searched nodes (p or q) is located on the right side of the current node, then the other node is located on the other side. Thus the current node is the common ancestor.
